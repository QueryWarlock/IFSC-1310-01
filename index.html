    <h2>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h2>
    <p>Web accessibility is important because it makes websites, applications, and technologies accessible to everyone, from disabled or neurodivergent individuals to neurotypical or highly functional adults. Tools I can find helpful include DAX or Dragon Naturally Speaking (DNS), which can help mitigate lost time from easy distractions or cognitive overload by automating calculations and repetitive tasks. </p>

      <p> Website design should be simple and direct to be user-friendly if I want to find something quick and productive. <q>Over-engineering</q> a site could pose more distractions for someone who is neurodivergent like me, but I can imagine a neurotypical person would also find it frustrating if a website is an unorganized mess or is less than appealing aesthetically.

<div class="Enhancement">
      <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>My Space X's HTML pages are uniform and navigable. By assigning older font styles, I ensured that even older browsers or devices with limited functionality could access pages.
      I made sure the webpage fit a rhetorical theme about space while making it simple and accessible navigation. I make simple scripts for 
      search and organizing functionality for the table in the history page, a popup module so you don't have to return to another webpage. 
      Images automatically fade to the next image, and the FAQ has a simple accordion behavior so a user doesn't get scroll fatigue.

      <div class="Reflection">
        <h2>Page Revision and Reflection</h2>
      <p>Because I had various users, my classmate William Moore, my partner, nieces and nephew, Mother, Sister, and a handful of friends, 
        I had many suggestions for redesigning my page. Although I am being graded for my understanding of web development on a PC, 
        many users wanted a mobile version of the site. This left an impression that most users are more phone-dependent in this day and age. 
        I haven't made a mobile friend media query for this assignment, but I will be working on understanding more about mobile development 
        this winter break. I am a computer science major, but I feel web development is an integral part of my skill set in the near future. 
        However, I attempted to solve scroll fatigue by ensuring I have a “back to top” anchor point and links at the bottom of each webpage 
        for easy navigation. I've also added an accordion script to combat scroll fatigue. My mother wasn't keen on the opacity of the header 
        and suggested I bolden the text, which I did. My partner suggested I resize my images, but they also don't like image galleries. 
        I want to dig deeper into this and research solutions for each user's tastes. My niece and nephew enjoyed the font and color scheme, 
        and they said it reminded them of space. My friends and sister also noticed some links didn't work, and my form wasn't functioning 
        properly. I researched how to insert a modal within my page so you don't have to exit the page.
