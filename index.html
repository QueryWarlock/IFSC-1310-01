    <h2>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h2>
    <p>Web accessibility is important because it makes websites, applications, and technologies accessible to everyone, from disabled or neurodivergent individuals to neurotypical or highly functional adults. Tools I can find helpful include DAX or Dragon Naturally Speaking (DNS), which can help mitigate lost time from easy distractions or cognitive overload by automating calculations and repetitive tasks. </p>

      <p> Website design should be simple and direct to be user-friendly if I want to find something quick and productive. <q>Over-engineering</q> a site could pose more distractions for someone who is neurodivergent like me, but I can imagine a neurotypical person would also find it frustrating if a website is an unorganized mess or is less than appealing aesthetically.
