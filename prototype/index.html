     <div class="Student Life Content">
    <p> The student life at UA Little Rock is typical of public universities in the 
      United States. It is characterized by student-run organizations and affiliation groups
      that support social, academic, athletic, and religious activities and interests. 
      Some of the services offered by the UA Little Rock Office of Campus Life are intramural 
      sports and fitness programs, diversity programs, leadership development, peer tutoring, 
      student government association, student support programs including groups for 
      non-traditional and first-generation students, a student-run newspaper, and fraternity 
      and sorority life. The proximity of the UA Little Rock campus to downtown Little Rock 
      enables students to take advantage of a wide array of recreational, entertainment, educational, 
      internship, and employment opportunities that are not available anywhere else in Arkansas<sup>[20]</sup>.</p>

    <div class="Campus Living">
      <h3>Campus living</h3>
    
    <p>UA Little Rock provides a variety of on-campus living options for students ranging from 
    traditional resident rooms to multiple-bedroom apartments. The university has four 
    residence halls on the eastern side of the campus and the University Village Apartment 
    Complex<sup>[21]</sup> on the southern side of campus. Six learning communities focusing on 
    criminal justice, arts and culture, majors and careers, future business innovators, 
    nursing careers, and STEM are available to students.</p></div>
    
    <div class="Athletics">
      
    <h3>Athletics</h3>
    
    <p>UA Little Rock's 14 athletic teams are known as the Little Rock Trojans, with 
      <s>almost</s> all teams participating in the <s>Sun Belt Conference</s> 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Valley_Conference">Ohio Valley Conference</a>. 
      <del>Little Rock is one of two Sun Belt members that do not sponsor football (UT Arlington being the other); 
        UA Little Rock last fielded a football team in 1955 when it was known as Little Rock Junior College</del>. 
        Little Rock's main athletic offices are located in the Jack Stephens Center. UA Little Rock offers the 
        following sports:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Baseball</li>
    <li>Men's and Women's Basketball</li>
   <li>Men's and Women's Golf</li>
    <li>Women's Volleyball</li>
    <li>Women's Soccer</li>
    <li>Women's Swimming/Diving</li>
    <li>Men's and Women's Cross Country</li>
    <li>Men's and Women's Track and Field (Indoor and Outdoor)</li>
    <li>Men's wrestling</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Two Little Rock teams that do not compete in the Sun Belt are the women's swimming and 
    diving team (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_Valley_Conference">Missouri Valley Conference</a>) 
    and wrestling (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-12_Conference">Pac-12 Conference</a>), neither of which the Sun Belt sponsors. Wrestling is the school's 
    newest sport, starting in 2019, and is the first Division I program in Arkansas.</p>
    
    <p>Little Rock will move to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Valley_Conference">Ohio Valley Conference</a> for the 2022-23 season.</p>
